## Objective:
The objective of the **Onyx Data Challenge** in March was to analyze the ****eBay used car sales dataset**** from **Germany** spanning from **1960 to 2020**. The aim was to derive insightful insights that would benefit stakeholders. 

By meticulously examining the data, the challenge sought to answer key questions such as the most purchased car brands, the states with the highest car purchases, and the optimal months for buying cars.

## Dataset Overview:

The dataset provided for this project consisted of used car sales data from various states in **Germany** spanning the years 1960 to 2020. It comprised **371,000 rows**, each containing a multitude of attributes related to the vehicles and their transactions.

#### Key Attributes Included:

| Column name | Description |
|--|--|
|Car Name: |vehicle name.|
|Seller: |Information about the entity selling the car (e.g., private seller, comercial).|
|Offer Type: |Type of offer (e.g., offer,request).|
|Price: |The listed price of the car.|
|ABTest: |Indicates whether the listing was included in an A/B test for different site designs.|
|Vehicle Type: |Categorization of the vehicle (e.g., sedan, SUV, coupe----).|
|Year of Registration: |The year the car was first registered.|
|Month of Registration: |The month the car was registered.|
|Gearbox: |Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic).|
|Model: |Specific model of the car.|
|Kilometer: |The distance the car has been driven (in kilometers).|
|Fuel Type: |Type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., petrol, diesel----).|
|Brand: |The brand or manufacturer of the car.|
|Repaired or Not:| Indicates whether the car has undergone repairs.|
|Postal Code: |The postal code of the location associated with the listing.|
|Latitude:| Geographic coordinate representing the north-south position.|
|Longitude: |Geographic coordinate representing the east-west position.|

## Data Preparation or Cleaning Step-

During the data preparation phase for this project, it was observed that the dataset contained several blank or null values in character-type data fields. 

 * These missing values were replaced with **'Undefined'** to ensure consistency and completeness in the dataset.

 * Furthermore, the **'year of registration'** field contained numerous inaccurate entries such as 1500, 1700, 1100, and 1000, which were clearly erroneous. Entries predating **1960** were replaced with the year 1960, while entries exceeding **2019 **were replaced with the year **2020**, ensuring more realistic and accurate data.

 * Similarly, in the 'month of registration' field, it was expected that values would range from 1 to 12 to represent the twelve months of the year. However, approximately 37669 rows contained the value '0'. These entries were replaced with '1', corresponding to January, to align with the expected scale of 1-12 for the months.

#### How I calculate AVG Years of car Old?
For calculating the average age of cars, I used a field named "New Year of Registration" and extracted the year from it by subtracting it from 01/01/2020. This allowed me to determine the age of each car accurately.
